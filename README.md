# Feedhub

As college students, meal plans are always desired but the costs can outweigh the benefits of having one. However, lots of students realize that they buy too large of a meal plan and what happens if they do not use them at the end of the semester? They go away and their universities profit. Feedhub is a group made application encourages students to share their extra meal plans as well get to know other students as well.
