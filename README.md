## About

As college students, meal plans are always desired but the costs can outweigh the benefits of having one. However, lots of students realize that they buy too large of a meal plan and what happens if they do not use them at the end of the semester? They go away and their universities profit. Feedhub is a group made application encourages students to share their extra meal plans as well get to know other students as well. This project was created and featured at CodeRED Fall 2015, where it received fourth place.
